# Automated dependency loading

This is an attempt to implement an automated dependencyLoader in Javascript.

Dependency loading is the act of injecting the dependencies in to a module/function/object, instead of
letting it create them itself.

## Why dependency loading?

To be added...

## How will it work?

The dependencyLoader will be optimized for usage with the Revealing Module Pattern.

It is required that the modules that's being loaded through the dependencyLoader are stateless.

## TODO

- Set up tests
- Create functionality to execute a function X
- Create functionality to get a modules dependencies
- create functionality to find another module based on the dependencies found
- ...
